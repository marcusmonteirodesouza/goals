# Goals

My life's goals.

## Project

See [my project](https://github.com/users/marcusmonteirodesouza/projects/3).

## Guidelines

Goals should be

* **S**pecific
* **M**easurable
* **A**ssignable
* **R**ealistic
* **T**ime-bound
* **E**valuated
* **R**ecognized

### Specific

#### What do I want to accomplish?

#### Why do we need to do this?

#### Who is involved?

#### Where does this needs to happen?

#### Which requirements and constraints are relevant?

### Measurable

* Motivate your team because actual progress can be seen and measured.
* Your team will have a clearer idea of when "done" will happen.
* Your team will more likely stay on track.
* Your goal will more likely get accomplished because of all the above.

#### How much?

#### How many?

#### How will I know when it is accomplished?

#### Indicators should be quantifiable.

### Assignable

If you can't find anyone who can achieve the goal, it's likely that it is not specific enough.

#### Who has the necessary skills to accomplish the task?

#### Is the task automatable? Can we get software to do it?

#### Does the goal need to be outsourced?

#### Can we find an external resource who can do it?

#### What resources are needed to accomplish the goal?

### Realistic

Begin with the end in mind, plan your steps wisely, and establish a time frame.

### Time Bound

### Evaluated

### Recognized

## My Goals

### Typical Day

My wife and I wake up at 6:00. I feel a little sore, but I got used to it over the years. I feel the lazyness bug making me want to stay in bed, cuddle and sleep some more, but at this point my discipline is such that the bug gets beaten and chased away yet another day. 

I wake my 2 kids up, if they are still asleep. They might not like it as much, but I think they will thank us later when they are teenagers and adults, plus it's nice to spend time together.

We brush our teeth, grab the gym bags we prepared the day before, and head out to the gym. The car is a very comfortable and safe SUV, a new model. My wife drives: she likes it better than I do.

We exercise until about 8:00, doing a bunch of classes or lifting weights. I feel strong.

After everyone has taken a shower we get breakfast, and we leave the kids at school.

After getting home I turn on my computer, I get together with my friends, chat for a while, then we start hacking away at our stupid ideas. I don't need to do it: I earn $400.000 CAD per year doing nothing. I do it because it's fun. 





















# Separate

Think about the meta-reasons and write a paragraph based on the big **WHY**s.

1 - 3 - 5 - and 10 year goal.

Write as paragraph.

30 - 60 and 90 day goal that is in line of the goal.

## Time-Focused. Master of my own time, master of my own body to make good use of my time.

## Be Fit

Is there something driving this? Why?

Because I like to travel and generally walk around (do hikes, and stuff) and I would like to be able to do those things for how long as I can.
